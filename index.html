  <p>The sound I created was inspired by the Rain Sound from Designing Sound by Andy Farnell on page 441. The main components of my sound come from 2 low-pass frequency filters and 2 high-pass frequency filters. One of the 2 low-pass frequency filters has an oscillator to add a frequency range. The two low-pass filters create raindrop noises hitting bigger objects, like the ground or car roofs. As recommended by the book, the range can be between 10 to 300 Hertz. I decided to add an oscillator to the 200 Hz low-pass filter because I think it offers a more dynamic complexity to the rain - like a low rumbling thunder. I also layered the two frequencies of 80 Hz and another frequency of 200 Hz. For the high-frequency band of sounds, they come from “secondary excitations” (as the book calls it).  They are referred to as “comfort noise and have a calming effect. I layered that with a 1000 Hz frequency and a 5000 Hz frequency to add some complexity to the ambience of the rain. This sound reminds me of a waterfall trail my family and I go hiking to. This sound captures the timeframe of the drizzling rain after a storm.
